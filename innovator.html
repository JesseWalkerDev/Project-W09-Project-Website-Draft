                <p>
                    Grace Hopper, born in 1906 in New York City, developed an early interest in engineering. After earning a bachelor's
                    degree from Vassar College and a master’s and Ph.D. from Yale, she taught mathematics at Vassar before joining the
                    Naval Reserve in 1943. In 1944, she worked on the Mark I, an early computer prototype, and wrote the first manual on
                    operating and programming computers. In 1949, she contributed to the UNIVAC project and helped develop COBOL, a
                    revolutionary programming language that used English words. Grace’s career included educating young people and
                    promoting accessible computing. She was promoted to rear admiral, serving until her final retirement at 79 in 1986,
                    earning many awards for her contributions to computer science.

                <h2>Under-representation</h2>
                <p>
                    Grace Hopper was underrepresented in both computer science and the Navy, fields largely dominated by men. As one
                    of the few women on her teams, she faced several challenges. One of these occurred when she tried to join the Navy
                    after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Initially rejected for being too small, Hopper persevered, eventually securing a waiver
                    for her weight and successfully joining the Navy, demonstrating her determination in the face of obstacles.

                <h2>Contributions</h2>
                <p>
                    Grace Hopper made enormous contributions to computer science, especially in the areas of software development and programming languages. These achievements are
                    strongly related to the three pillars of informatics: computational thinking, design thinking, and sociotechnical thinking. Her creation of the first compiler, A-0, which
                    converted mathematical code into a format that was usable by machines, was one of her major contributions. This accomplishment is fundamental to computational thinking
                    because it made it possible for programmers to formulate issues in a fashion that computers could understand and solve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, Hopper made significant contributions to COBOL, a business-oriented, user-friendly programming language. By concentrating on the requirements of non-specialist users, this program embodies design thinking and makes technology accessible to a wider audience. Her work with FLOW-MATIC, the first programming language in English, further demonstrates design thinking by advocating for word-based commands over symbols, which made programming more intuitive for individuals without a technical background.

                <h2>Selection</h2>
                <p>
                    When we were brainstorming for our group project, none of us felt strongly about any
                    particular person at first. As we discussed who we had chosen for individual projects,
                    we realized that half of our group had focused on Grace Hopper. She was the only
                    person that multiple group members had chosen, which led us to consider why we were
                    drawn to her. We recognized that her contributions still have a significant impact on us
                    today, and that connection made us feel she was the right choice.
