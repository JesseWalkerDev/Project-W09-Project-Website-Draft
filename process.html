            <h2>Initial Research</h2>
            <p>After talking about Grace Hopper in class, it was a unanimous choice of who we should do this project on. Seeing her contributions to computer science,
                NASA, and many other spaces, it was hard to look for another candidate to present for this project. Grace Hopper has proved herself a staple through all
                she had done and accomplished</p>

            <h2>Past Assignments</h2>
            <p>Some past assignments such as the Project Charter and Project research have helped expand our knowledge of Grace Hopper and how we can
                accurately and appropriately pay homage to her achievements throughout her time. Although there have only been a few assignments as of now, we look
                forward to future assignments like these that will help us to continue our broad scope of knowledge.</p>

            <h2>Group Review</h2>
            <p>Throughout these assignments and the project all around, having a group that is so dedicated to not only receiving a great grade, but also towards
                representing Hopper properly, it has made this entire process so much easier. We have a system to hold each of us equally accountable for our faults,
                and what we may need to work on, while having positive communication and focusing on constructive criticism rather than strictly criticizing.</p>

            <h2>Website Feedback</h2>
            <p>Our team interviewed a handful of people, many of who had similar thoughts and opinions. One of the main suggestions was for us to add more content to the Home Page. Two people suggested we add a brief summary of Grace Hopper to the Home Page. The next most common suggestion was for us to clarify programming and computer science terms/acronyms. Our interviewees were confused because they didnâ€™t know what those terms meant. In addition, several people did not like how the Innovator Page was laid out. We received many different suggestions on how we could change the layout.</p>
